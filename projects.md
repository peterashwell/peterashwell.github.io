<h1>Peter's parking project</h1>
<a href="petersparkingproject.com">petersparkingproject.com</a>
<p>A smart city project using computer vision and networked cameras to eliminate the pain of parking forever. Constructed a prototype with some basic computer vision techniques for the city of Borgholm. Unfortunately prototype performs poorly as environmental conditions (locations of parking spot, seasons) have changed since it was built and optimised. More to come.

<h1>Basil Framework</h1>
<a href="http://basilframework.com">basilframework.com</a>
<p>A backend as a service that aims to make web development better by providing typical web application components, such as chat, login and file uploading as interfaced components that can link to both the backend and frontend of your application.</p>

<h1>TrackerKeeper</h1>
<a href="http://trackerkeeper.co">trackerkeeper.co</a><br />
<p>A website for keeping track of the multimedia links one consumes day to day, sharing them with others, and organising them into playlists. Prototyped in four hours using google forms and some hacky jquery.</p>

<h1>Men's Style Forum Analysis</h1>
<p>Scraped the complete history of <a href="http://www.styleforum.net">men's style forum</a>. Analysis to come</p>

<h1>4chan analysis</h1>
<p>Scraped several months of popular 4chan boards /b/, /v/, and /g/ with the objective of filtering out the typical low-quality content and extracting creative and interesting posts.</p>
