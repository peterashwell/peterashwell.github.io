<h1>PhD in Natural Language Processing (not completed)</h1>
University of Sydney, <a href="https://schwa.org">&#x0259;-lab</a>

<p>I spent a year in the excellent schwa lab under the supervision of Dr. James Curran. I was briefly researching opinion mining and then delved into the difficult problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation">word sense disambiguation</a>, in particular techniques for improving the performance of the closely-related problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_induction">word sense induction</a>, the extraction and construction of <em>sense inventories</em> automatically from text corpora. Both problems boil down to discerning what <em>sense</em> of a word is being applied in a given context, e.g. the word bass in the two contexts:</p>

<blockquote>
	Big dirty stinkin' bass<br />
	A fine salty bass fresh from the sea
</blockquote>

<p>Distinguishing <em>coarse</em> senses, the distinctions between things so different as a frequency of sound and a marine animal, have good performance. The difficulty of the problem lies more in differentating meanings of closely related senses, such as wood in a forest versus wood in a cutting board. The contextual differences are not so great and confusion begins to occur. The importance of resolving these senses accurately is demonstrated by the frequent failures in machine translation programs.</p>

<p>My work was centered on using datasets of unprecedented size in word sense induction to improve on the state of the art accuracy in WSI systems. I was working with an enormous dataset (~50GB text) scraped from the DMOZ open directory project, an inventory of category-labelled websites from across the internet.</p>

<p>I suspended my PhD a little over a year after joining the lab to try freelance software engineering, then effectively left the lab by not resuming it (losing my scholarship) at the beginning of 2013. I am very happy I had the privelege to experience research, be a part of the lab and its lovely characters, and explore a problem as interesting as word sense disambiguation, a problem stretching to the depths of meaning itself. The skills, knowledge and wisdom I developed conducting research have been a great asset to me ever since, and I will forever have a passion for discovery and learning.</p>
