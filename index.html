	<p>Hi, I'm a software engineer in Sydney, Australia. I write a lot of python and javascript, and try to use my skills to make useful and interesting things.</p>

	<p>I work at Freelancer.com, and previously held a number of interesting freelance, contract and part-time jobs. I graduated with a Bachelor of IT, honors first class, from the University of Sydney, and I started but did not finish a PhD in Natural Language Processing at <a href="https://schwa.org">schwa lab</a>.</p>

	<p>I try to find as much time as I can to work on various <a href="{{site.url}}/projects">projects</a> I think are interesting.</p>
