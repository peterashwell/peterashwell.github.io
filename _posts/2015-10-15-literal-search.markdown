So sometimes you need to literally search for something, probably if you're a developer. Try finding info on `set -x`, the bash mode, in Google.

You can't right? Or maybe if you go down several pages. Jesus - what decade am I in again? I thought putting "" around stuff made it literal. It doesn't.

Try this instead: http://symbolhound.com/?q=set+-x

Google apparently has verbatim search but that was also buried, so yeah. Sorry Google, not that impressed I gotta say.
