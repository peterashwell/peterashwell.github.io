<p>This was pretty easy barring one nasty gotcha that was hard to track down. I followed the official Jekyll guide and that was all good except my page would just not publish and just say 404. There wasn't a lot of information as to what was going wrong until I read <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-github-pages-build-failures/">this</a> and realised I didn't have a verified email address. I wasn't getting emails telling me the build had failed also because I didn't have an email address. So, if you're confused because it's failing without any reports and somehow google dumps you here... yeah... give that a check.</p>

<p>But now I have this sweet blog and website! Just need to get it themed and use something other than Jekyll.</p>
